"# Youtube-Live-Stream-Chat-App" 

An app which displays the Youtube livestream live chat on your Desktop.

How to use it:
1. Run the Executable(.exe) file
2. Just paste the URL of that particular livestream for which you want to display the live chat
3. Go to Google Cloud -> Search -> Youtube Data API V3 and Enable it
4. go to API and services -> Credentials create an API copy the key
5. paste the API key in the App Save and Continue


It uses Google Cloud API in order to reduce the resource usage on your computer 
instead handled by Google to extract the youtube messages efficiently


Somehow the executable file is 155MB which is too big for it to be uploaded on GitHub apparently.
Let me figure out someway to compress and optmize it till then hold your horses.
Also I havent figured out what to name my App
